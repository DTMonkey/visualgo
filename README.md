Motivation
This project was conceptualised in 2011 by Dr Steven Halim as a tool to help his students better understand data structures and algorithms, by allowing them to learn the basics on their own and at their own pace. Together with two of his students from the National University of Singapore, a series of visualisations were developed and consolidated, from simple sorting algorithms to complex graph data structures.
Though specifically designed for the use of NUS students taking various data structure and algorithm classes (CS1020, CS2010, CS2020, and CS3233), as advocators of online learning, we hope that curious minds around the world will find these visualisations useful as well.

Ongoing developments
This is an ongoing project, and more complex visualisations are still being developed. Originally developed using HTML5 Canvas, we are currently redesigning the site to harness the power of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) instead. An automated testing system is also in the works.

Publications
This work has been presented briefly at the CLI Workshop at the ACM ICPC World Finals 2012 (Poland, Warsaw) and at the IOI Conference at IOI 2012 (Sirmione-Montichiari, Italy).
